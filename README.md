# my_atm_app
my bank (more like an ATM application) can:
1) register a user by log-in and user password (id the code generates randomly)
2) log in using the log-in and password
3) top up and withdraw balance
4) hash password
5) show history

The code itself uses a SQLite table to write and read information for the code
